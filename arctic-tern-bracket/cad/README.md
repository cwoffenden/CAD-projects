# Source CAD Files

These were created in [BricsCAD](//www.bricsys.com/bricscad-mechanical)'s sheet metal tool (the files should be viewable in AutoCAD).

This was built iteratively, first the generic PCIe bracket (a useful starting point for any other projects), then with mounting arms for the Arctic Tern card (for systems that don't need to expose the ports), and finally with cutouts for the network and HDMI ports.
