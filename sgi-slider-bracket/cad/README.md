# Source CAD Files

These were created in [BricsCAD](//www.bricsys.com/bricscad-mechanical) (the files should be at least viewable in AutoCAD).

The files are:

- `slider-adapter.dwg` the sheet metal replacement slider ends; the model is of the right-hand front, mirrored for the left-hand front on export (the right-hand front is also the left-hand rear and vice versa)
- `drill-template.dwg` 3D printed template to mark the drill holes; it clips in place and allows a 1.5 pin punch to leave an accurate mark on the metal
- `washer.dwg` 3D printed washer for the rear inner rail screw to allow the release mechanism to freely move
- `o350-saw-jig.dwg` optional 3D printed jig to hold the inner rail to aid cutting the 11mm to better fit an Origin 350 type chassis (the O300 is longer and does not need this)
- `o350-rail-filler.dwg` optional 3D printed part to plug the outer rail after cutting the 11mm excess

The exported production files are in [out](../out).
