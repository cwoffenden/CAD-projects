# Silicon Graphics Rack Adapter Brackets

Converts the readily available [Inter-Tech 650mm rails](//www.inter-tech.de/productdetails-136/2U_TELESKOPSCHIENENSATZ_650MM_EN.html) for use with SGI Origin bricks, tested with Origin 350 and Origin 300 chassis. Order Inter-Tech part `88887211`, remove the rack mounts keeping only the outer and inner rails, then screw in these adapters (with the supplied M4 5mm long screws).

The original SGI solid bearing slider is very difficult to find; the inner rail is often attached to a chassis but the outer part has long gone. The originals look like General Devices [C300 series 26" rails](//catalog.generaldevices.com/Asset/C-300-S.pdf) with two open slots, but having spoken with General Devices they don't think they're the same. So... these were made as replacement!
