# POWER9 AM5/SecuFirm2 Cooler Mount

`p9-cooler-bracket.dwg` is the replacement for the IBM cooler mount. It should be fabricated in aluminium 7075 with a surface finish of 3.2Âµm, bead blasted and anodised (I chose *natural* for the prototypes). The instructions to the machine shop are:

> Tolerances should be ISO 2768 fine. Threads are required and are marked on the drawing (take note of the 3.5x0.9mm counterbore in the M3.5 threads, which has been added to the model). Threads are all the way through. The *Text* layer in the `DWG` contains the (optional) laser engraving. Racking preference is either inside the unthreaded holes or on the opposite side of the laser engraving (with all of the round features and steps, not the flat side). The finish should be clean and smooth.

For use with a Noctua air cooler having a 78mm SecuFirm2 pitch (e.g. NH-U12A), insert two 16mm M3.5 socket head screws in the bracket's underside with threadlock. Take note of the cooler's offset mounting, accounted for in the bracket design, centring the cold plate on the CPU. Testing with a Thermal Grizzly 50x50mm Kryosheet pad the temperatures are 10-15 degrees less than the stock IBM 3U HSF.

The main intended use was water cooling. To be continued...
